## 🔐 Authentication Workflow

1. **Sign Up** – Create a new account (username + password).
2. **Sign In** – Login using credentials.
3. **Logout** – Clear session and return to login screen.

Passwords are stored securely (hashed) in SQLite.

## 🌱 Data Entry

* Users can add crop name and number of saplings.
* Data is saved in the **entries** table.
* Reports are generated by grouping total saplings per crop.

---

## 📊 Reports

Sample JSON response from `/reports`:

```json
{
  "reports": [
    {"crop": "Mango", "total_saplings": 120},
    {"crop": "Banana", "total_saplings": 80}
  ]
}
```

## 🌍 Language Support

UI texts are translatable between:

* English
* Hindi
* Marathi
* Gujarati
* Tamil
* Telugu

---

## ✅ Verification Workflow

* Users can trigger a simulated multi-step verification (Data Check → Validation → Approval).
* Steps update dynamically with ⏳ (pending) → ✅ (done).

---

## 📌 To-Do / Improvements

* [ ] Add session-based login instead of localStorage.
* [ ] Role-based access (Farmer, Admin, Verifier).
* [ ] Export reports to CSV/PDF.
* [ ] Mobile app version (React Native / Flutter).
